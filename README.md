# BE A GREAT HUMAN - THE QUIZ
## “Get through life without looking dumb (or dying)”

What kind of footprint do you leave on the world? What impact do you have on the people around you? Do you know how to deal with emergency situations? Being a good person doesn't have to be a pretentious sweater you show off - all it takes is paying attention to the little details in life.
The goal is simple - choose a category and answer questions. Each question will have multiple choice answers, and after selecting your answer you will receive points - or not! At the end of a category you will see your total score and learn how close you are to being a "perfect person". (FYI - no such thing.)

##Basic Improvements (not quite Ice Box)

list here

##Ice Box 

Categories -> after finishing 1st category & seeing score, user can proceed to the other categories & keep updating their total score, rather than only re-starting
Score handling complexity -> instead of only correct/incorrect, have a "maximum amount of points" for guessing correctly the first time, and subtract points for each incorrect guess
Secret page - if user achieves perfect score, show a unique "super winner" page
