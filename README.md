What kind of footprint do you leave on the world? What impact do you have on the people around you? Do you know how to deal with emergency situations? Being a good person doesn't have to be a pretentious sweater you show off - all it takes is paying attention to the little details in life.<br>
The goal is simple - choose a category and answer questions. Each question will have multiple choice answers, and after selecting your answer you will receive points - or not! At the end of a category you will see your total score and learn how close you are to being a "perfect person". (FYI - no such thing.)

## Basic Improvements (a.k.a. not quite Ice Box)

- change timer to display mins:seconds instead of only seconds
- add more questions & more categories
- 

## Ice Box Features

- Score handling complexity -> instead of only correct/incorrect, have a "maximum amount of points" for guessing correctly the first time, and subtract points for each incorrect guess
- Category handling -> after finishing 1st category & seeing score, user can proceed to the other categories & keep updating their total score, rather than only re-starting
- Secret page -> if user achieves perfect score, show a unique "super winner" page
