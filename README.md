What kind of footprint do you leave on the world? What impact do you have on the people around you? Being a good person doesn't have to be a pretentious sweater you show off - all it takes is paying attention to the little details of life.
The goal is simple - choose a category and answer questions. Each question will have multiple choice answers, and after selecting your answer you will receive points - or not! At the end of a category you will see your total score and see how close you are to being a "perfect person". (FYI - no such thing.)
